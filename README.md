## Overview

The Website was designed to give a fluent & professional look & feel to it within each part & provide the best possible usability for the user. The font "Mentserrat" was chosen as I feel that this font really helps provide that look & feel. 

## Navbar

When arriving on the website, the navbar will be displayed with a Navbar Logo on the left-hand side which will navigate you to the home page & on the right-hand side will be nav items on the on desktop & a hamburger icon on mobile. This can hide when a user scrolls down the page & will re-appear when a user starts scrolling back up. When at the very top of the page, the Navbar background will transition to have a transparent background.

#### Mobile & Tablet

The mobile display shows a hamburger icon that will toggle & off & change the CSS of each item in the hamburger menu. When active, a side drawer will slide out & will show nav items, when you hover over each of them, a white underline will animate outwards. When active, a backdrop will also appear to highlight the side drawer opening; when clicked the side drawer will slide back in. The Sidedrawer will also slide back in when the user begins to scroll down the page & will be hidden on Desktop display, this is to create a better UX.

#### Desktop

The desktop display shows nav items on the right-hand side & a white underline will also animate outwards when nav items are hovered over when the navbar is at the top of the page.


## Unleash Section

The Unleash text will slide in when a user is presented with the website, This will show different coloured text & an active state on "Let's talk" which will animate a pink underline when hovered over. On the other side is a picture of a spaniel. Each of the two parts will be one of top of the other on a mobile & tablet display & side by side on a desktop display.


## What are we capable of

The "What are we capable of" section will slide in when a user scrolls to it. This has been sectioned out will the ability of bootstrap. Also when brand strategy is hovered over, the chevron icon will rotate & a dropdown will animate into view. There is an "Our Process" label that has an animated underline when hovered over.


## Some of our recent projects

The "Some of our recent projects" section will slide in when a user scrolls to it. In this section, you will be presented with a tab section with "All" set to default. You can flick between each of the categories by clicking on the heading, the pink underline will trail to that specific tab heading. Each of the projects has its own category so will work just like a real category section & will show the relevant category for each tab selected. You can also hover over each of the items & it will show an active state for each project. Also, there is a "See all work" label that has an animated underline when hovered over. The buttons are there primarily for hover effect only.


## Case Studies

The "Case Studies" section will slide in when a user scrolls to it. You will have the ability to be able to slide from each different case studies using a slick slider, you can either scroll to each of case studies by dragging or you can use the arrows that have been provided. This is slightly different from the original design & each of the images are the same but this is to demonstrate it in a working slider. Also, I think the mobile & tablet display could definitely be improved but it's the best approach I could think of for the images that were provided.


## What are we all about

The "What are we all about" section will slide in when a user scrolls to it. You will be presented with a masonry gallery effect. This has been implemented with the help of bootstrap & is also responsive. There is an "About" & a "Careers" label that has an animated underline when hovered over.


## Kind words from our clients

The "What are we all about" section will slide in when a user scrolls to it. You will be presented will testimonial cards & an active card that is presented at the front, the active card is slightly larger in size & coloured differently to the inactive ones. This is responsive & will show only one at a time on mobile & tablet & three on desktop. Indicators are also present at the bottom of the cards & the user can click to each one from them.

## Footer

The "Footer" section will slide in when a user scrolls to it. This has been sectioned out will the ability of bootstrap. There is a "Let's talk" label that has an animated underline when hovered over. Also, each of the social media icons will transition to their original colour when hovered over.


## Back To Top Icon

I know this wasn't on the scope but I thought it would be nice to add a "Back to top" Icon to the top of the page, it creates a much better UI/UX. This has been styled so that it will disappear when a user is at the top of the page & will animate back in when the user scrolls down the page. When hovered over, it will also animate a dark blue border. This will also smooth scroll back to the top to prevent clunkiness.
