## Navbar

When arriving on the website, the navbar will be displayed with a Navbar Logo on the left-hand side which will navigate you to the home page & on the right-hand side will be nav items on the on desktop & a hamburger icon on mobile. This can hide when a user scrolls down the page & will re-appear when a user starts scrolling back up. When at the very top of the page, the Navbar background will transition to have a transparent background.

#### Mobile & Tablet

The mobile display shows a hamburger icon that will toggle & off & change the CSS of each item in the hamburger menu. When active, a side drawer will slide out & will show nav items, when you hover over each of them, a white underline will animate outwards. When active, a backdrop will also appear to highlight the side drawer opening; when clicked the side drawer will slide back in. The Sidedrawer will also slide back in when the user begins to scroll down the page & will be hidden on Desktop display, this is to create a better UX.

#### Desktop

The desktop display shows nav items on the right-hand side & a white underline will also animate outwards when nav items are hovered over when the navbar is at the top of the page.
